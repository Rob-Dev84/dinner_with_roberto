You should be fine if you use the same pan.  It still came out wonderful. \r\nWe served it with chicken noodle soup and I will definitely be making it again."

I think because I followed the instructions to the tee, my bread didn't turn out as I'd have liked. I should have done the 2nd proof in the oil lined pans.. Because I had to move the dough for a second time, mine deflated somewhat..  The bread did look beautiful once baked. Just not enough flavor."

Like some others, I skipped the rolling step and just spread the dough in the pan to do the second rise. Brushed with  garlic infused olive oil with a sprinkling of Italian seasoning, Cooked quite a bit longer than suggested,  about 27 mins or so."

I have now made this weekly for a month and I see no reason to stop. Also: I highly recommend using truffle-infused oil for the drizzle."
